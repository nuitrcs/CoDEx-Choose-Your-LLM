# During the workshop

If you're stuck during the hands-on exercises, we have a [document with some sentences to try running the models and some models with Inference API Widgets that you can use](https://github.com/nuitrcs/CoDEx-Choose-Your-LLM/blob/main/help_with_exercises.txt). Before going to that document, though, we encourage you to try on your own!
